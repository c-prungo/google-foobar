Google Foo Bar is Google's secret recruiting process embedded within their search engine. There are 5 levels, each with a different number of challenges that follow a story.

Inside each level is a challenge folder with a problem file describing the challenge and constraints, and my solution to the challenge.

Have a look at [story.md](https://github.com/c-prungo/google-foobar/blob/main/story.md)
